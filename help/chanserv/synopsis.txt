^BChanServ^B gives normal users the ability to maintain control
of a channel, without the need of a bot. Channel takeovers are
virtually impossible when a channel is registered with ^BChanServ^B.
Registration is a quick and painless process. Once registered,
the founder can maintain complete and total control over the
channel. Please note that channels will expire if there are no
eligible channel successors. Successors are primarily those who
have the +R flag set on their account in the channel, although
other people may be chosen depending on their access level and
activity.
