^BGroupServ^B is a bot that is special to our network. It allows
users to register groups and add users to them, with the indirect
benefit of having custom group vhosts. Groups may also get other
benefits such as private sections in pastebins and wikis. Group
channels use group memberships as access lists instead of lists
of users and what they can do.
